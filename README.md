# KF5042

A link to the dataset, as it is too large to upload to github https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sabahesaraki/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset
it should be extracted to the same directory as main.m, and preprocess.m, and then the folder should be renamed to "breastCancerDataSet", and processed using preprocee.m, before running main.m
